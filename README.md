<h1> Research Abstract </h1>
<p>
    This work evaluates the performance of different estimators in the domain of Portfolio Optimization. 
    Three different estimators, namely sample based, Ledoit-Wolf (LWE), 
    and Rotationally Invariant Estimator (RIE) are evaluated on their 
    ability to approximate Covariance matrices, 
    as well as how these Covariance matrix approximation 
    affect the portfolio optimization process.
