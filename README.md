# Research Abstract

This work evaluates the performance of different estimators in the domain of Portfolio Optimization. 
Three different estimators, namely sample based, Ledoit-Wolf (LWE), 
and Rotationally Invariant Estimator (RIE) are evaluated on their 
ability to approximate Covariance matrices, 
as well as how these Covariance matrix approximation 
affect the portfolio optimization process.  The general conclusion is that LWE outperforms SCE and RIE under most 
conditions, while RIE outperforms in a few different scenarios.
